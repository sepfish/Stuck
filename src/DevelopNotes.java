/*Hey, where am I now??
 *11/9: You just implemented "checking" an InteractObject. You were trying to make it turn red when it was checked.
 *11/16: You have problems with the isChecked setting back to false when it turns true - (try making the INteractObject its own little variable inside of GamePanel, not in the ObjectManager)
 *11/23: THANK GOD THAT PROBLEM IS SOLVED HHHHHH
 *		 anyway, you're debating whether to stick all the InteractObjects in an ArrayList
 *		 you should also start thinking about puzzles (finding key fragments (hehe Jevil), batteries for things, notes & passwords, etc)
 *		 you also created an inventory class... but pretty much didn't do anything in it
 *11/30: You did it. You implemented the ArrayList. You also created your first Inventory mock-up (it looks so bad hahaha)
 *		 You should start thinking about puzzles!!!! You also need to create more InteractObjects, and maybe get started on the art. 100px by 100px drawings seem pretty good for the inventory.
 *		 Maybe you should pixellate those Love Nikki home avatars haha
 *12/7:  JOKER FOR SSBU
 *		 anyway the inventory is pretty gucci right now, you fixed the "going down" problem
 *		 You need to implement a way to unlock things... (seeing as you have a key and you found out how to lock things now)
 *		 also put some art in bro!!!
 *		 and find some way to unlock the door
 *12/14: it's taku's birthday
 *		 You started doing (basic) graphics... do more :)
 *		 still need to find out how to unlock things
 *		 also puzzles
 *12/21: winter break bois
 *		 You did some more graphics... do more graphics
 *		 There's a problem with the chest and the mirror on the first floor swapping graphics, for whatever reason.
 *		 Also work on things mentioned above. Also fix the door graphics.
 *12/28: it's orlando's birthday? ok sure happy birthday orlando
 *		 Fixed the going down problem. Again.
 *		 Switched some colors around, introduced character moving states (for future graphics)
 *		 There's a problem with setting the images for the InteractObjects - they'll only draw the last image that was set, even though each InteractObject should have their own variable?

	/*PUZZLES
	 * - The key to the door is under the door itself, so you have to find some kind of long stick/broom
	 * - One of the chests is locked. You have to find the key to the chest. Inside the chest is ...
